        The zeroMatrix function sets all elements in the matrix to 0 that are in
        the same row or column as a 0 element. It does this by first creating
        two sets, rowsToZero and colsToZero, which store the indices of rows and
        columns that contain a 0 element. Then, for each row index in
        rowsToZero, it sets all elements in that row to 0. Similarly, for each
        column index in colsToZero, it sets all elements in that column to 0
